# TLabNetworkedVR
For VR development in Unity  
Assets supporting synchronisation of objects in VR space  

## Note
- TLabVRGrabber has been renamed TLabNetworkedVR due to expanded functionality.
- Due to continued destructive updates, I recommend those who want to use the stable version to download the package from the release.

## Features
- Supports both hand tracking and controllers
- Rigidbody Synchronization
- VoiceChat
- Websocket and P2P together
- Sync Animator
